# Challenges

Homework I give myself to learn about new CS stuff.

## Why?

I loved [Algorithm Design](http://www.fc.ul.pt/en/disciplinas/201415/425116-algorithms-design-and-analysis) at FCUL and miss having to read through textbooks that I can barely comprehend. :green_book:

## Material

I'll use these to research and find good tasks.
